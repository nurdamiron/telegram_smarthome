# telegram_smarthome

This project was created to manage a smart home using a telegram bot.
Through telegram bot you can check:
1. Room temperature, outside temperature and room humidity
2. How much power consumption is going on at the moment inside your home
3. Safe mode (turns off power consumption, sends messages via telegram when motion, fire or carbon monoxide is detected)
4. Control of LED lamps, ribbon via web application (brightness adjustment, color change)
5. Cooling and heating mode

The most important thing is that all this works remotely, where you have not been, you will have the opportunity to receive data from your home.
